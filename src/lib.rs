//! fact.rs is a nonlinear least squares optimization library over factor
//! graphs, specifically geared for sensor fusion in robotics.
//!
//! Currently, it supports the following features
//! - Gauss-Newton & Levenberg-Marquadt Optimizers
//! - Common Lie Groups supported (SO2, SO3, SE2, SE3) with optimization in Lie
//!   Algebras
//! - Automatic differentiation via dual numbers
//! - Serialization of graphs & variables via optional serde support
//! - Easy conversion to rerun types for simple visualization
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! Specifically, we solve the following problem,
//!
//! $$
//! \blue{\Theta^*} = \red{\argmin_{\Theta}}
//! \sum_{i} \green{\rho_i(||r_i(\Theta)||_{\Sigma_i} )}
//! $$
//!
//! The fact.rs API takes heavy inspiration from the [gtsam library](https://gtsam.org/),
//! and is loosely structured as follows,
//! - <blue>Variables</blue>: These are the unknowns in the optimization
//!   problem. They are all lie-group based (even if trivially so). See the
//!   [variable](crate::variables) module for details on custom implementations.
//!   A collection of variables is stored in a
//!   [Values](crate::containers::Values) container.
//! - <red>Optimizers</red>: The optimizer is responsible for finding the
//!   optimal variables that minimize the factors. More info on factor graph
//!   optimizers in [Optimizers](crate::optimizers).
//! - <green>Factors</green>: Each factor represents a probabilistic constraint
//!   in the optimization. More info in [Factor](crate::containers::Factor). A
//!   collection of factors is stored in a [Graph](crate::containers::Graph)
//!   container.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use factrs::{
//!     assign_symbols,
//!     core::{BetweenResidual, GaussNewton, Graph, Huber, PriorResidual, Values, SO2},
//!     fac,
//!     traits::*,
//! };
//!
//! // Assign symbols to variable types
//! assign_symbols!(X: SO2);
//!
//! // Make all the values
//! let mut values = Values::new();
//!
//! let x = SO2::from_theta(1.0);
//! let y = SO2::from_theta(2.0);
//! values.insert(X(0), SO2::identity());
//! values.insert(X(1), SO2::identity());
//!
//! // Make the factors & insert into graph
//! let mut graph = Graph::new();
//! let res = PriorResidual::new(x.clone());
//! let factor = fac![res, X(0)];
//! graph.add_factor(factor);
//!
//! let res = BetweenResidual::new(y.minus(&x));
//! let factor = fac![res, (X(0), X(1)), 0.1 as std, Huber::default()];
//! graph.add_factor(factor);
//!
//! // Optimize!
//! let mut opt: GaussNewton = GaussNewton::new(graph);
//! let result = opt.optimize(values).unwrap();
//! println!("Results {:#}", result);
//! ```

/// Easiest way to create a factor
///
/// Similar to `vec!` in the std library, this is a macro to create a factor
/// from a residual, keys, and alternatively noise and robust kernel. A simple
/// usage would be
/// ```
/// # use factrs::{assign_symbols, fac, core::{SO2, PriorResidual, BetweenResidual}, traits::*};
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// # let between = BetweenResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// # assign_symbols!(X: SO2);
/// let prior_factor = fac![prior, X(0)];
/// let between_factor = fac![between, (X(0), X(1))];
/// ```
/// Additionally, there is a number of helper options for specifying a noise
/// model,
/// ```
/// # use factrs::{assign_symbols, fac, core::{SO2, PriorResidual, GaussianNoise}, traits::*};
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// # assign_symbols!(X: SO2);
/// let noise = GaussianNoise::from_scalar_sigma(0.1);
/// let f1a = fac![prior, X(0), noise];
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// let f1b = fac![prior, X(0), 0.1 as std];
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// let f2 = fac![prior, X(0), 0.1 as cov];
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// let f3 = fac![prior, X(0), (0.1, 0.3) as std];
/// ```
/// where `f1a` and `f1b` are identical, and where `f3` uses
/// [from_split_sigma](factrs::noise::GaussianNoise::from_split_sigma)
/// to specify the rotation and translation noise separately. (where rotation is
/// ALWAYS first in factrs)
///
/// Finally, a robust kernel can be specified as well,
/// ```
/// # use factrs::{assign_symbols, fac, core::{SO2, PriorResidual, Huber}, traits::*};
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// # assign_symbols!(X: SO2);
/// let f1 = fac![prior, X(0), 0.1 as std, Huber::default()];
/// # let prior = PriorResidual::new(SO2::identity());
/// let f2 = fac![prior, X(0), _, Huber::default()];
/// ```
/// where `f2` uses [UnitNoise](factrs::noise::UnitNoise) as the noise model.
pub use factrs_proc::fac;
/// Mark an implementation of [Variable](factrs::traits::Variable),
/// [Residual](factrs::traits::Residual), [Noise](factrs::traits::NoiseModel),
/// or [Robust](factrs::traits::RobustCost).
///
/// This is mostly to aid in serialization when the `serde` feature is enabled.
/// Since these items are boxed inside [Factor](factrs::core::Factor), we use
/// `typetag` for serialization which requires a little bit of manual work.
///
/// For examples of usage, check out the [tests](https://github.com/rpl-cmu/factrs/tree/dev/tests) folder.
///
/// Specifically, it does the following for each trait:
///
/// ### [Variable](factrs::traits::Variable)
/// If serde is disabled, does nothing. Otherwise, it does the following:
/// - Checks there is a single generic for the datatype
/// - Add tag for serialization
/// - Add tag for serializing
///   [PriorResidual\<Type\>](factrs::core::PriorResidual) and
///   [BetweenResidual\<Type\>](factrs::core::BetweenResidual) as well.
///
/// ### [Residual](factrs::traits::Residual)
/// This should be applied on a numbered residual such as
/// [Residual2](factrs::residuals::Residual2) and will automatically derive
/// [Residual](factrs::traits::Residual). Additionally, if serde is
/// enabled, it will add a tag for serialization.
///
/// ### [Noise](factrs::traits::NoiseModel)
/// If serde is disabled, does nothing. Otherwise, it will tag the noise model
/// for serialization, up to size 32.
///
/// ### [Robust](factrs::traits::RobustCost)
/// If serde is disabled, does nothing. Otherwise, it will tag the robust
/// kernel.
